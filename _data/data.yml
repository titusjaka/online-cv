  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I'm a Golang developer with a DevOps background.  
    I'm experienced in Go, microservices, ElasticSearch. I'm also a bit familiar with JavaScript, Python, and C#.

    Team and tasks are important to me.  
    If the team discusses issues together, negotiate and find compromises — then we will work together well.  
    If the tasks are diverse and require brainstorming — I am in.

    I'm looking for a job as a back-end developer in the product team or outsourcing company. Startups are welcome too.  
    I have experience in setting up processes within the team. So I'm also considering the position of the team leader.  
    I would be happy to discuss the opportunities.
