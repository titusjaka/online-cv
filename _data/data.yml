  summary: |
    I'm a Golang developer with a DevOps background.  
    I'm experienced in Go, microservices, ElasticSearch. I'm also a bit familiar with JavaScript, Python, and C#.

    Team and tasks are important to me.  
    If the team discusses issues together, negotiate and find compromises — then we will work together well.  
    If the tasks are diverse and require brainstorming — I am in.

    I have experience in setting up processes within the team. So I'm also considering the position of the team leader.
